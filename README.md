**Who is this application for?**  
Our target audience is a small group of animal lovers, and animal advocates in Donelson, TN who voluntarily rescue lost and stray animals in the city. There will be an open door for similar groups in the surrounding area.


**What problem will this application attempt to solve?**  
This group has recovered thousands of animals. At this point, they are keeping track of their efforts in a spreadsheet that gets passed around from one volunteer to another. They update the information in the spreadsheet based on their own experience and by communicating with other members in the group. Greater structure, connectivity, and centralization would simplify updating the list as well as allowing it to be used as a resource for finding animals.


**How will this application solve this problem?**  
The data on the spreadsheet will be moved to an accessible database. The application will provide the volunteers an interface for performing basic CRUD operations on the data. Where applicable, each entry will have a link to the relevant Facebook post(primary communication tool). Data will be sortable in order to simplify the task of finding a specific entry.


**What is the minimum viable product?**  
The database will be set up on Heroku along with a functioning instance of Apache and PHP. Visitors will be able to perform basic CRUD operations on on the database.
